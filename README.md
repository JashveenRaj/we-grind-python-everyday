# **We-grind-python-everyday**  

This is my personal Python playground. Here, I upload the codes I write as I learn, practice, and solve problems. Nothing fancy, just me getting better at Python one grind at a time.  

## What's in Here?  
1. **Basic Problem Solving**: From loops to functions to figuring out why `int()` hates my input.  
2. **Data Structures** *(coming soon-ish)*: Once I’ve wrestled the basics, I'll be diving into stacks, queues, trees, and all that good stuff.  

## Why?  
Because practice makes better (and because I don’t trust my local storage not to randomly delete my files).

Feel free to browse or use anything here if it helps you too. Or don’t. I’m just here coding my way to the holy grail of python.
